Codsoft Internship Tasks
This repository contains the code and documentation for the tasks I received during my Codsoft internship. The internship provided valuable learning experiences and opportunities to work on real-world projects.

**Task 1: Number Game**

Objective: Develop a number guessing game that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

Steps:

Generate a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback (correct, too high, or too low).
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
Optional Enhancements:

Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.


**Task 2: Grade Calculation**

Objective: Create a program to calculate a student's total marks, average percentage, and assign grades based on their marks in various subjects.

Steps:

Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.
Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
These tasks demonstrate your ability to develop interactive games and perform calculations based on user input. Feel free to include more details, code snippets, or explanations for each task in your Git repository to showcase your work during the Codsoft internship.

**Task 3: ATM Interface**


Objective: Create an ATM Interface program that mimics the functionality of a real ATM machine.

Steps:

User Authentication:

Implement a basic login system that requires users to enter a PIN to access the ATM features.
Ensure that unauthorized users cannot access the ATM functionalities.
Main Menu:

Design a user-friendly main menu that presents various ATM options to the user, such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, and exit.
Balance Inquiry:

Develop a feature that allows users to check their account balance.
Display the current balance to the user on the screen.
Cash Withdrawal:

Implement the ability for users to withdraw cash from their account.
Ensure that users cannot withdraw more money than their account balance allows.
Provide options for different withdrawal amounts (e.g., $20, $50, $100).
Cash Deposit:

Create a feature for users to deposit cash into their account.
Allow users to specify the amount they want to deposit.
Transaction History:

Keep a record of all ATM transactions, including withdrawals, deposits, dates, and times.
Allow users to view their transaction history.
Security Features:

Implement security measures such as locking the user's account after multiple incorrect PIN attempts.
Protect sensitive user information and transactions.
Exit and Logout:

Provide an option for users to safely exit the ATM session and log out.
User-Friendly Interface:

Design a clean and intuitive user interface that guides users through the ATM operations.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to address common issues, such as insufficient funds, incorrect PINs, or system errors.
Documentation:

Create clear and concise documentation for the ATM simulator, including user instructions and any technical details.
Testing and Debugging:

Thoroughly test the ATM simulator to ensure that all features work as expected.
Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.
This Task 3, the ATM Simulator, will showcase your ability to design and implement a user-friendly and secure software application that simulates ATM functionality. You can add this description to your Git repository alongside the other tasks to document your internship projects effectively.
